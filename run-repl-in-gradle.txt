From the console a number of options are needed to run the REPL:

--no-daemon, if you are using a Gradle daemon. At the moment, the REPL does not respond to keystrokes if run from the daemon.
--console plain. A popular, but inferior alternative is --quiet. If run without one of these options, REPL's prompt is contaminated by Gradle's progress report. --console plain has the advantage that it also adjusts readline's behaviour so that rlwrap is unnecessary.

Full command to run the REPL is gradle repl --console plain --no-daemon, so creating an alias in your shell makes sense.

So:

gradle repl --console plain --no-daemon

println(new java.io.File(".").getCanonicalPath)
-> /Users/eatobin/scala_projects/p-in-scala

so:

:load scripts/pis-97.scala
